            <h4>
                <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar ( 14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, and social
                    reformer who fought economic and social discrimination against the untouchables (now dalits) in India's
                    Hindu society, and who later renounced Hinduism and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement.
                    Ambedkar served as chairman of the drafting committee of the Constitution of India, and Minister of Law
                    and Justice in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru from 1947 to 1951.
                    He is also referred to by the honorific Babasaheb.<br><br>
                    Ambedkar was a prolific student, earning doctorates in economics from both Columbia University and the
                    London School of Economics, gaining a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics and
                    political science.In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was
                    marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's
                    independence, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and
                    contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to
                    Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.

                    In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The
                    salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him.</p>

                <p class="bs"><br>“Freedom of mind is the real freedom.
                    A person whose mind is not free though he may not be in chains, is a slave, not a free man.
                    One whose mind is not free, though he may not be in prison, is a prisoner and not a free man.
                    One whose mind is not free though alive, is no better than dead.
                    Freedom of mind is the proof of one's existence.”</p>
                <p class="bs"><br>“Cultivation of mind should be the ultimate aim of human existence.”</p>
                <p class="bs"><br>“Humans are mortal. So are ideas. An idea needs propagation as much as a plant needs
                    watering. Otherwise both will wither and die.”</p>
                <p class="bs"><br>“Equality may be a fiction but nonetheless one must accept it as a governing principle.”
